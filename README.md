# Autoclcliker
This autoClicker uses a program called autohot key one the program with autohotkey and press f1 on your keyboard to activate it.
Autohotkey.exe is the program used to use the autoclicker.
When you download Both run the exe file then after that click exit on auto hot key.
When you are done run the Ahk script named "Tk's autoclicker" then press f1 to play the script i recomend useing a website like https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/ or, https://cpstest.org/.
press f1 again to pause it and then you have an autoclicker ready for use if you want to stop the program completely go to task manager and end the process.
IF you want to change the speed of the clicks (in miliseconds) edit the file by rightclicking it and click edit then change the zero to whatever number IN MILISECONDS you want.
